# CurtainLED

A project that I started early on 2020. Now it is time to put in a use and add new features !

WS2812B addressable LEDs formed in a L shape and woven inside the side folds of translucent curtain. ESP8266 as NodeMCU V3 board is used to control the LEDs and to have the IoT capability.

## Features to Implement
- A web interface to control the LEDs.
- Fancy animations.
- Time and weather awareness.
- Average power consumption.
- Google Assistant Support.
- Wireless power (linear).
